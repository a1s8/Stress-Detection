# Stress Detection

## Overview
This project predicts stress levels using physiological features like heart rate, respiration, blood oxygen level, etc.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Features: Heart rate, respiration, body temp, etc.
- Labels: Stress levels (0-4)

## Models Used
- SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost

## Results
- **KNN achieved the highest accuracy (100%)**, followed by **Random Forest (99.37%)** and **CatBoost (98.73%)**, indicating that non-linear models and ensemble methods are highly effective for stress detection.

## Future Improvements
- Feature engineering for better predictions
- Experimenting with deep learning models
